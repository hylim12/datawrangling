"""
For the histogram of "Distribution of Rental Prices for Houses in Brooklyn", the shape can be observed that it is a right-skewed distribution.
Prices are spread across a wide range but most of the rental prices are clustured in the lower range with 50 dollars having the highest frequency.
The higher the prices, the fewer the listings causing the tail of distribution to the right.
Prices above the upper limit and lower limit are excluded which eliminates outliers in this histogram.

Distribution of Price
Shape: The histogram for price is likely to be right-skewed, with a large number of listings clustered at lower price ranges and fewer listings as the price increases.
This suggests that most Airbnb listings are relatively affordable, with only a small proportion of listings being high-priced. 
The skewness might indicate that luxury or high-end properties are less common on the platform.

Distribution of Number of Reviews
Shape: The histogram for number_of_reviews may also be right-skewed, showing that most listings have received a relatively small number of reviews, while a few listings have received a very high number of reviews.
This could suggest that a majority of properties are either new or not heavily reviewed, while a few popular listings have garnered a large number of reviews. 
This could indicate varying levels of popularity or occupancy among the listings.
